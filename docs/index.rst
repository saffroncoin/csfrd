csfrd
==================================================

cSFR is a protocol for the creation and use of decentralised financial instruments such as asset
exchanges, contracts for difference and dividend payments. It uses Bitcoin as a transport layer.
The cSFR protocol specification may be found `here <https://github.com/cSFRXCP/cSFR>`__.

``csfrd`` is the reference client (and server daemon) implementation of the cSFR protocol.

To get ``csfrd`` installed and set up on your computer, you have two options:

- Set it up manually, using the instructions `here <https://github.com/cSFRXCP/csfrd/blob/master/README.md>`__
- For Windows and Ubuntu Linux users, you can use the `automated build system <http://csfrd-build.rtfd.org>`__
